# Hex to Decimal Quiz

## Description
A simple Python program that generates a random hexadecimal number and prompts the user to convert it to its decimal equivalent. I wrote this because David Bombal's free quiz was taken down from his website on or around 10/5/2023

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Usage
Run the program in a terminal:
\```bash
python hex2dec.py
\```

## Features
Generates a random hexadecimal number.
Allows the user to input their guess for its decimal equivalent.
Provides feedback on whether the guess is correct or incorrect.
Option to quit the program by entering 'q'.
